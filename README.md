Project name: Coffee Shop Start Page
Description: This is the start page of the Triple Peaks Coffee Shop. This page aims to hook potential clients and allow them to make a reservation without having to call or directly go to the shop location.

This project was done with HTML and CSS.

Upcoming improvements:

The focus pseudo class could be used to highlight the input field in the reservation form. The "Reservar una mesa" button could be disabled by default.
